Given the head of a sorted linked list, delete all nodes that have duplicate numbers, leaving only distinct numbers from the original list.
Return the linked list sorted as well.

Constraints:
The number of nodes in the list is in the range [0, 300].
-100 <= Node.val <= 100
The list is guaranteed to be sorted in ascending order.
